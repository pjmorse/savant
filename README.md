# Savant

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/terriblelabs/savant.png)](https://travis-ci.org/terriblelabs/savant)

Savant extends ActiveRecord by allowing you to easily create queries and reports
for your application's models by defining aggregate models in terms of dimensions
and measures.

_This is a pre-beta work-in-progress, and should not be used in production by
those without a sense of adventure. :-)_
